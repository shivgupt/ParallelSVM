# ParallelSVM

In this project I have parallelized training procedure for SVM algorithm using Hybrid approach i.e. OpenMp and MPI. OpenMP works effectively on shared memory systems, while MPI can exploit the computation power of multiple nodes using message passing, it has a significant communication overhead.
